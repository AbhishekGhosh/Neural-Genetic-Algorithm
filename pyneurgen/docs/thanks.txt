Thanks
================================================

I have benefitted from a number of great resources.  I should particularly
note the book Biologically Inspired Algorithms for Financial Modelling by
Anthony Brabazon and Michael O'Neill where I read about the technique
'grammatical evolution'.  I particularly like the simplicity for mapping
genotypes to programming applications, coupled with ease of controlling the
level of complexity necessary accomplish the task.  There are a number of
other applications for grammatical evolution that would great to implement as
well.

I should also note the book Adaptive Learning of Polynomial Networks by
Nikolay Y. Nikolaev and Hitoshi Iba.  While I would like to support polynomial
networks in this package, it was not possible in the initial version.  This
book has a very lucid discussion of fitness landscapes.  My fitness objects
benefitted greatly from their discussions of fitness functions.

Any mistakes in implementation are my own.
