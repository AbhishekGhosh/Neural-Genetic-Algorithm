<h2>Grammatical Evolution Tutorial:</h2>
<p>This tutorial presents a short, easy problem to solve using Grammatical
Evolution techniques with this software.  The example uses only the
grammatical evolution portion rather than a hybrid for clarity.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>The quickest way to install is with easy_install.  Since this is a Python library,
at the Python prompt put:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">easy_install</span> <span class="n">pyneurgen</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>The problem is fairly trivial, but should be sufficient to gain an
appreciation for methods to solve problems using grammatical evolution.  The
problem to solve:</p>
<p>For values 0 to 99, what expression could be used to minimize:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nb">abs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">expression</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="nb">pow</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The program will come up with an appropriate answer.</p>
<p>The first step, import modules that we will use:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">pyneurgen.grammatical_evolution</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">GrammaticalEvolution</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">pyneurgen.fitness</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">FitnessElites</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">FitnessTournament</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">pyneurgen.fitness</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">ReplacementTournament</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">MAX</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">MIN</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">CENTER</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The next task is to specify a grammar that will be referenced as well as a
stub of a program, or at least an appropriate starting point to get the
evolutionary process running.  Then, we define some of the starting
parameters.</p>
<h3>Backus-Naur form</h3>
<p>The point of the grammar is to define variables and the possible
assignments that can be made to the variables.  It is by the use of
grammatical evolution that assignments of the variables will be made, and
final assembly of a program.  There is one program generated per genotype. Any
language can be defined by the grammar, as long as there is an appropriate
executor when it comes to runtime of that program. In this case we will stick
with Python. The grammar uses a Backus-Naur form (BNF), with a structure
of:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="sr">&lt;variable&gt;</span>   <span class="o">::=</span> <span class="n">this</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">list</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">options</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A variable is identifiable because of the angle brackets around it.  It
is also separated from the list of options by ::=.
The following is the BNF that will be used for this example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">bnf</span> <span class="o">=</span>   <span class="s">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="s">&lt;expr&gt;              ::= &lt;expr&gt; &lt;biop&gt; &lt;expr&gt; | &lt;uop&gt; &lt;expr&gt; | &lt;real&gt; |</span>
<span class="s">                        math.log(abs(&lt;expr&gt;)) | &lt;pow&gt; | math.sin(&lt;expr&gt; )|</span>
<span class="s">                        value | (&lt;expr&gt;)</span>
<span class="s">&lt;biop&gt;              ::= + | - | * | /</span>
<span class="s">&lt;uop&gt;               ::= + | -</span>
<span class="s">&lt;pow&gt;               ::= pow(&lt;expr&gt;, &lt;real&gt;)</span>
<span class="s">&lt;plus&gt;              ::= +</span>
<span class="s">&lt;minus&gt;             ::= -</span>
<span class="s">&lt;real&gt;              ::= &lt;int-const&gt;.&lt;int-const&gt;</span>
<span class="s">&lt;int-const&gt;         ::= &lt;int-const&gt; | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |</span>
<span class="s">                        7 | 8 | 9 | 0</span>
<span class="s">&lt;S&gt;                 ::=</span>
<span class="s">import math</span>
<span class="s">total = 0.0</span>
<span class="s">for i in xrange(100):</span>
<span class="s">    value = float(i) / float(100)</span>
<span class="s">    total += abs(&lt;expr&gt; - pow(value, 3))</span>
<span class="s">fitness = total</span>
<span class="s">self.set_bnf_variable(&#39;&lt;fitness&gt;&#39;, fitness)</span>
<span class="s">        &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As you can see, there are a number of variables and optional values that
can take place.  Note that some of the options are variables that have angled
brackets, and some do not.  Those that do not are <strong>terminals</strong>;
the selection process ends when a terminal is selected.  If a variable selected,
the program uses the BNF to recursively evaluate the value of the variables found
until a terminal is reached.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that <strong>&lt;real&gt;</strong> is selected.  The
program will see <strong>&lt;int-const&gt;</strong>.<strong>&lt;int-const&gt;</strong> and will
evaluate the variables one by one. Upon looking up the definition of
<strong>&lt;int-const&gt;</strong>, it will find a list that could be any of the following
elements:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="sr">&lt;int-const&gt;</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="mi">4</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="mi">6</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="mi">7</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="mi">8</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="mi">9</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Using a selection process, which will be covered below, the program will select
a number or the <strong>&lt;int-const&gt;</strong> and recursively operate until
<strong>&lt;real&gt;</strong> is defined as a number.  At that point, the
program will continue with the next variable.</p>
<p>There is also the <strong>&lt;S&gt;</strong> which is the starting point. The
starting point can be minimal and open-ended, or fairly structured and limited
in scope, depending upon the needs of the problem. One other thing, when laying
out the starting point in code, take into account the use of whitespace in
Python.  Since this BNF is defined using a string in the form of """text""", the
returns and spacing will be used in formatting the statements.  That is the
explanation for the unaesthetic yet important layout above.  This caveat only
applies to a series of statements in the BNF, not the definitions of variables.
There are examples found in the demos directory with this package, if there is
still some confusion about it.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>There are some features here that are specific to this implementation.</p>
<p>Note that from a Python standpoint that it has <strong>self.</strong> in the
front of the fitness desnignator. That is because the fitness computation
takes place within the Genotype namespace. If for some reason, you would like
to intoduce a function from the Genotype class, it can be available in your
program.</p>
<p>Another implementation specific feature is
<strong>self.set_bnf_variable('&lt;value&gt;', value)</strong>.  The purpose
is to save a variable within the BNF during runtime.  This can be useful to
temporarily assign during the course of the program. This feature enables the
possibility of extending the BNF during runtime.</p>
<p>You should be careful, however, when saving variables that the spirit
of reproducability is maintained.  While assignment of variables is apparently
random, you will want a specific genotype to always assign in exactly the same
fashion.</p>
<p>Finally, there is an implementation specific feature that must be followed.
When the fitness computation has ended, the <strong>&lt;fitness&gt;</strong>
variable with the BNF is used as the fitness value.  In this case, total is
assigned to fitness, which is then saved to the BNF.  The sheer redundancy is
used here to help emphasize that <strong>if there is no fitness assigned upon
completion all of your genotypes will fail every time.</strong></p>
<h3>Mapping from the Genotype</h3>
<p>It is the structure of the genotype that defines the choices that are made
for options. Genotypes in genetic algorithms, and with this implementation as
well, use strings such as '01010111' and '10110111' to define a genotype.
Grammatical evolution translates those values 8 bits at time into lists of
decimal values, such [73, 45, 56, 1, 101]. It is this list that will be used as
the basis for determining what option is selected.</p>
<p>The basis for selection derives from the use of remainders. The following
example will make this clear:  Suppose that <strong>&lt;biop&gt;</strong> has been selected
and the mapping process needs to determine whether the choice is '+', '-', '*',
or '/'.  The mapping process takes the next number from the genotype in the
list.  Suppose that number is 73.  The choice is then made on the basis of:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">options</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;+&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;-&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;*&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;/&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">codon</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">73</span>
<span class="n">choice_number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">codon</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">options</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">choice</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">options</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">choice_number</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This results in a choice_number of 1, and the '-' option selected.</p>
<p>That choice made, the next substitution will be made on the basis of the next
number in the genotype sequence.  When all the numbers in the list have been
drawn, then the genotype sequence can wrap around and start at the beginning.
The program defaults to wrapping around.  If the end has been reached, yet more
are needed, then the genotype will be marked as a failure and move on to the
next.  The genotype can also be extended in lengh with the wrapped values as
well. The rationale for this is that mutations in an extended genotype might be
able to make minor changes in the extended genotype without affecting the
earlier portions.  It is not totally clear that this arrangement is any better
than simply starting out with a longer genotype.</p>
<h3>Setting the Evolutionary Parameters</h3>
<h4>Genotype Lengths</h4>
<p>To review, the modules have been imported, and the BNF has been defined. Now
the parameters for running the program need to be set.  Below, the
GrammaticalEvolution class is substantiated, and an initial length is set at 20,
extending up to 500.  This length, by the way, is the length of the decimal list
of numbers.  The population size is set to 50, and the genotype will wrap if it
hits the end of the genotype list. While mapping the genotype to the fitness
program uses the decimal form of the genotype, crossovers and mutations are
performed on the binary form.</p>
<p>Also shown below is loading the BNF into the GrammaticalEvolution class.
The load converts it to a dict form with each variable name as a key.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">ges</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">GrammaticalEvolution</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="n">ges</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_bnf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bnf</span><span class="p">)</span>

                        <span class="n">max_gene_length</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">50</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">ges</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_population_size</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">50</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">ges</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_wrap</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<h4>Stopping Criteria</h4>
<p>The next set of parameters control the course of the process. The
<strong>set_max_generations</strong> function sets the maximum number of generations that will be run.
If a fitness value is also set, the number of process will halt upon reaching the
goal. If the goal is not reached, then it will stop at the maximum generations.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">ges</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_max_generations</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1000</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">ges</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_fitness_type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">MIN</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">.</span><span class="mo">01</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The fitness selection process for each generation in this case is to
minimize the difference between the generated number and the cube of the
number.  In other words, the closer the fitness value is to zero, the
more fit that it is likely to be.  Fitness types have a choice of 'max',
'min', 'center'. Given that we want to hit zero, the fitness_type in this
case is 'center', and if a fitness value gets below .01, then that is deemed
close enough.</p>
<h4>Genotype Failures</h4>
<p>Declaring failure is an important part of this process.  Failure declaration
can occur for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program generated grows to greater than 500 characters</li>
<li>The program generated is syntactically incorrect</li>
<li>It takes more than 10 seconds to generate the program.</li>
<li>It takes more than 120 seconds to run the program.</li>
<li>Some program fault such as dividing by zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>When failure has occurred, the fitness value is set to the fitness_fail
value. Since every problem can be a little different, in this case the fail
value is set 100.0, since we want something close to zero.  That way, the
likelihood of replacement of that genotype is drastically increased.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">ges</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_max_program_length</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">500</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">ges</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_timeouts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">120</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">ges</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_fitness_fail</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">100.0</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<h4>Fitness Selections</h4>
<p>The selection process for fitness should emphasize selecting successful
genotypes and replacing less successful versions.  However, success being a
relative thing, including some less successful versions in a later generation
might well lead through crossovers and mutations to a much more successful
genotype.  In this program, up to 50% are being replaced.  We are using two
types of fitness selection, FitnessElites, and FitnessTournament.  FitnessElites
takes the top 5% in this case and puts them in the list for reproduction and
mutation. Then, a tournament process is used, where randomly, a pair of
genotypes are drawn with replacement and the best genotype is added to the list.
 This continues until the fitness quota is met, 50% in this case.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">ges</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_fitness_selections</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">FitnessElites</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ges</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fitness_list</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">.</span><span class="mo">05</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="n">FitnessTournament</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ges</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fitness_list</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">tournament_size</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="n">ges</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_max_fitness_rate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Once the fitness selection has been made, genotypes are modified by both the
crossover operator and the mutation operator.  Both operators act on the binary
version of the genotype.  Crossovers are performed on 20% in this case.
Crossovers take place by selecting pairs, swapping from a single point parts of
binary genotypes. A choice can be made for the number of children, either one or
two. If one is selected, that one of the two crossed is selected randomly.  In
this case we are using two.</p>
<p>The mutation operator can act in one of two ways.  It can select a genotype
for mutation at the mutation probability rate.  If mutated, it changes one bit
in the genotype.  This is a mutation type of 's' for single.  Or, each genotype
in the fitness selection list can be mutated at the probabilistic mutation rate
on a bit by bit basis.  This mutation type is 'm' for multiple, since a
particular genotype is at risk to be modified multiple times, depending upon the
mutation rate.  In this case, 'multiple' has been selected and the mutation rate
is 2.5%</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">ges</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_mutation_rate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mo">025</span><span class="p">)</span>

</pre></div>


<h4>Replacements</h4>
<p>The replacement process is very similar to the fitness selection, although in
reverse.  In this case, ReplacementTournament is used where a tournament is
conducted with 3 participants, and the worst is replaced. Replacements continue
until all of the genotypes on the fitness selection list have been replaced.</p>

        <span class="n">ReplacementTournament</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ges</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fitness_list</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">tournament_size</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<h4>Other</h4>
<p>A history of fitness lists can be maintained through a run.  Seeing the
history of fitness values per generation can give much insight into other ways
to evaluate the problem.  Summary values from each list are available as well,
such as mean, median, best_value, worst_value, and standard deviations.</p>
