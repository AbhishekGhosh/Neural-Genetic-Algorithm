<h1>Suggestions for using Grammatical Evolution</h1>
<h2>Limit your search space</h2>
<p>Part of the appeal in using such a technique derives from not necessarily
knowing the search space of possible solutions.  In other words, if you
had a better technique that would effectively solve the problem you would
use it. So, there can be a tendency to simply try everything that you can
imagine, and let grammatical evolution sort it out.</p>
<p>This will not work, because you can easily build a search space that is so
enormous, that even with many generations, only a fraction of the space can
be evaluated.</p>
<p>Try to use as few choices as you can, but not less than you need.  Unfortunately,
this is art not science for this choice.</p>
<h2>Limit Your Program Size</h2>
<p>An equation or code generation machine does not know at the time that what is
being produced is useful or not.  The code for any particular iteration can
end up with a repetitive, degenerate looping of odd functions that have no
meaning or usefulness.  By limiting the program size, your process can cut off
the program generation so that less time is used testing unproductive programs.</p>
<h2>Use Program Size as Part of Your Fitness Value</h2>
<p>Suppose that your process generates many solutions that are sufficently close
to your fitness value, but many of those solutions have code that is fairly convoluted,
such as sin(cos(-3.3 * sin(cos(2. * x)))).  Push the solution toward simple and
elegant approaches by using the size of the program to modify your fitness
value.</p>
<p>The generated test program runs within the name space of the genotype. This means that
you have access to the self values.</p>
<p>Here is a slight example to illustrate the concept. Just before executing the generated
program, a copy is put in the local_bnf of the genotype object.  Assume that the
purpose of a run is to maximize a fitness_value:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="o">...</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">rest</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">your</span> <span class="n">generated</span> <span class="n">program</span> <span class="n">would</span> <span class="n">be</span> <span class="n">above</span> <span class="n">here</span>

<span class="c">#</span>
<span class="n">fitness_value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">some</span> <span class="n">generated</span> <span class="n">value</span> <span class="n">here</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

<span class="n">program_size</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">local_bnf</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;program&#39;</span><span class="p">])</span>

<span class="n">fitness_value</span> <span class="o">/=</span> <span class="n">program_size</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Larger programs would decrease the fitness value more than smaller programs, giving
your process a basis for favoring smaller solutions.  In addition, if a particular
function is being built, you could simply parse the program for that function and
evaluate on the size of that function alone.</p>
<h2>Design Your Fitness Value Approach</h2>
<p>Try to design the process to generate fitness values that can move ever closer to an
effective solution.  Suppose your process was a random process and you simply wait for
the best fitness value to show up.  Generally speaking, such a process will take longer
than a process where the system can learn from previous generations and effectively
improve on past generations.  So, where possible try to design your process so that the
right answer is not just a shot in the dark.</p>
<h2>Create Your Own Fitness Class</h2>
<p>You can create your own fitness class.  For example, a comparison could be made of the
distribution of fitness values versus your own criteria. Such a technique might derive
from the need to create a family of solutions, rather than just a one.</p>
<p>This technique for doing this could be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a function that accepts the fitness_list and evaluates in some fashion.</li>
<li>Return True to continue processing.</li>
<li>Return False to end the process.</li>
<li>Add the function to the grammatical evolution class.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">ges</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">GrammaticalEvolution</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">ges</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stopping_criteria</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">STOPPING_FITNESS_LANDSCAPE</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">new_fitness_function</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
